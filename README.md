# Project Description

This is my first "Full Stack Software Development" project created for the subject "Programming and Programming Languages" in my fourth year of high school.

## Background
During this project, I hadn't yet learned to use GitHub on any other IDE or Code Editor besides Visual Studio Code.

## Current State
As a result (of not knowing GitHub), this project is still publicly available on here - I think it is sweet to show the beginnings. However, I plan to make changes to its accessibility in the future.

## Project Scope
This project showcases my capabilities in creating a full-stack software application, including a database. Fortunately, we had an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) ready, which simplified the database design process. Without it, the database aspect would have been more challenging.

## Reflection
This project marks my humble beginnings in software development. Despite its limitations, I'm proud of it as it played a significant role in shaping my coding skills and "coding character" development.

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback or suggestions!
